He examines the life cycle of nonprofits and NGOs including the entrepreneurial and start-up process, environmental conditions that support scale and sustainability, and dimensions of competition that lead to organizational decline or failure. A central theme in the work is how the dynamics of economic markets for grants shape nonprofit behaviors and impact program quality, as well as how public and nonprofit sector organizations conceptualize, measure, and report on effectiveness. He actively promotes open science in academics and data science in the public and nonprofit sectors. He is a co-founder of the Nonprofit Open Data Collective, Data Science for Public Service (DS4PS), and the ARNOVA Data and Analytics Section. He recently launched a new M.S. in Program Evaluation and Data Analytics at Arizona State University, a degree tailored to a social science audience that was designed to meet the growing demand for analytical skills in the public sector. He teaches courses in management, statistics, program evaluation, data science, GIS, and urban policy.*
